Recreating the page that was created in a video by Hyperplexed in here:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJYFRZ4cj2Q

It will be a the menu page of the website Studio9P: https://studio9p.com/en/

Notes:
Things I need to check after this video:
- display values
- flex direction
- position relative on the parent to fix the gradient
- gradient function
